# axa React/Redux
Third party libraries - Axios, since there is just one GET request could be also just fetch() instead of Axios, but...
Testing - pretty small and simple app, could've tested 'infinite scroll' a bit, but it's too simple. i just tested the URL, to be sure that we get the data and we get it in format we need!
Error handling - Normally i'd use HOC to handle them, but again, nothing to handle pretty much, except a 'catch' after request.
